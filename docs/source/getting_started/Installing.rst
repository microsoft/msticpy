Installing
==========


Python 3.8 or Later
-------------------

*MSTICPy* requires Python 3.8 or later.
If you are running in hosted environment such as Azure Notebooks,
Python is already installed. Please ensure that the Python 3.8 (or later)
kernel is selected for your notebooks.

If you are running the notebooks locally, you will need to install Python 3.8
or later. The Ananconda distribution is a good starting point since it comes
with many of packages required by *MSTICPy* pre-installed.

Creating a virtual environment
------------------------------

.. note:: This is an optional step. You will most likely want to do this
   if you are installing *MSTICPy* in a local Python installation. If
   you are using a cloud notebook environment such as Azure ML you
   will usually not need to create a virtual environment.

*MSTICPy* has a significant number of dependencies. To avoid conflicts
with packages in your existing Python environment you may want to
create a Python virtual environment
or a conda environment and install the package there.

For standard python use the ``venv`` command to do this
(there are also several alternatives to venv available).

.. code:: bash

    ~$ python -m venv my_env
    ~$ ./my_env/scripts/activate
    (my_env) ~$

For Conda use the conda ``create`` command from a conda shell.

.. code:: bash

    (base) c:\users\ian> conda create -n my_env
    (base) c:\users\ian> conda activate my_env
    (my_env) c:\users\ian>

You should see the name of the environment that you've just
created and activated in the prompt.


Installation
------------

Run the following command to install the base configuration of *MSTICPy*.


``pip install msticpy``

or for the latest dev build

``pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy``


Selective Installation - using "extras"
---------------------------------------

pip supports specification of an additional parameter sequence
known as extras. The syntax for this is:

``pip install package_name[extra1,extra2,...]``

As of version 0.9.0 *MSTICPy* has its dependencies split into
extras. This allows you to install only the packages that you
need and avoid the overhead of time and disk space of dependencies
that you do not need.

.. note:: extras do not affect the which code from *MSTICPy* is
   installed - only the external libraries on which certain
   functions inside *MSTICPy* need to work.

.. warning:: zshell/MacOS users - you need to escape the first "[".
   Otherwise this is interpreted as the start of a file pattern
   match expression. In other shells such as bash you may find that
   you need to escape the leading "[" if the extra name matches
   the pattern of local files in your current directory.

   .. code:: bash

      pip install msticpy\[riskiq]

   If you are installing a specific version number you should
   also escape one of the "=" characters

   .code:: bash

      pip install msticpy\[vt]\==1.8.2

The installation times here are meant to be indicative of comparative
times for installation - they will vary depending on the performance of
your computer and network.

The *Install time (increment)* column shows times relative to
the base install (i.e. assuming you've already run ``pip install msticpy``).
The *Install time (full)* column shows the time to install the base
plus extra. Both columns assume that the following packages are already
installed: jupyter, pandas and matplotlib.

If you do not specify an "extra" in your pip install command, the base
dependencies for *MSTICPy* will be installed. This has a lot of functionality
such as networking, pivoting, visualization but excludes most dependencies
that are specific to a particular data environment like Azure Sentinel or
Splunk.

Some of the extras, like "all" and "azsentinel" are combinations of
other options collected together as a convenience. You can also specify
multiple extras during install, separating them with commas.

.. code:: bash

    pip install msticpy[azure,kql]

.. warning:: when specifying multiple extras, do not leave spaces between
   the options - just separate with commas.

Missing "extra" exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you try to use functionality for a component that needs a dependency
that you have not installed you will usually get an informative
exception message telling you which "extra" option you need to use
to enable that feature.


.. figure:: _static/extra_exception.png
   :alt: Exception when trying to use a function that is not installed.
   :height: 3in

To fix this simply run pip install with the "extra" option shown in the
exception message:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install msticpy[ml]

.. note:: In some cases you many not get an informative error. We've
   tried to trap all of the cases but if
   experience a problem with some *MSTICPy* functionality (especially
   an *ImportError* exception, make sure
   that you have installed the *extra* that corresponds to the
   functionality you are trying to use.

Installing in Managed Spark compute in Azure Machine Learning Notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*MSTICPy* installation for Managed (Automatic) Spark Compute in Azure Machine Learning workspace requires
different instructions since library installation is different.

.. note:: These notebook requires Azure ML Spark Compute.
   If you are using it for the first time, follow the guidelines at
   `Attach and manage a Synapse Spark pool in Azure Machine Learning (preview)
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-synapse-spark-pool?tabs=studio-ui>`__

Once you have completed the pre-requisites, you will see AzureML Spark Compute
in the dropdown menu for Compute. Select it and run any cell to start Spark Session.

Please refer to
`Managed (Automatic) Spark compute in Azure Machine Learning Notebooks
<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/interactive-data-wrangling-with-apache-spark-azure-ml>`__
for more guidance and screenshots.

In order to install any libraries in Spark compute, you need to use a
conda file to configure a Spark session.
Please save below file as conda.yml , check the Upload conda file
checkbox. You can modify the version number as needed.
Then, select Browse, and choose the conda file saved earlier with
the Spark session configuration you want.

Installing for isolated or semi-isolated environments
-----------------------------------------------------

There are instances in which you may want to use msticpy in an isolated
or semi-isolated environment (e.g. an environment that does not have internet
PyPI access to install packages and dependencies).

To do this you need to build a transportable archive of MSTICPy and its
dependencies and use that as the source to install from in your target environment.

We have included a set of scripts to simplify some of this process. These
are available in the `tools folder <https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy/tree/main/tools>`__
of the MSTICPy repo.

- ``build_wheel_from_targz.py`` - builds wheel files from source tar.gz files
- ``install_all_whl_files.py`` - installs all .whl files in a directory to the target environment
- ``download_python_package.py`` - downloads a python package and its dependencies to a directory.
  This script uses docker to perform the download and allows you to build an install
  package for a Linux environment from a Windows environment.

In the instructions below we give both the manual steps and the script-based steps.
The latter are recommended to avoid repetitious typing and to avoid missing files.

For either manual or script-based installation it is **essential** that you
use the same Python version for both source and target environments, since
pip will download the correct version of the package for the Python version
that it is executing in. We recommend creating a virtual Python or Conda
environment for this purpose (this isn't required for the docker-based
script).

In order to find the correct python version, you can run the following:

.. code-block:: powershell

    python --version


Windows Source to Isolated Windows Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. On your primary Windows machine with internet access create a virtual environment
   for the python version you want to use in the target environment.
2. Download msticpy by running the following:

.. code-block:: powershell

    python -m pip download msticpy --dest \path\to\destination

Within ``\path\to\destination`` you should see a .whl file for msticpy and the other dependencies.
Some dependencies may not be .whl files, but tar.gz files.
These files will need to be built into .whl files. To do this, run the following
for each tar.gz file:

.. code-block:: powershell

    python -m pip wheel {file.tar.gz} -w \path\to\destination

or use the script from MSTICPy repo "tools" folder to process all files
`build_wheel_from_targz.py <https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy/blob/main/tools/build_wheel_from_targz.py>`__
to build all the tar.gz files in a directory.

3. Zip and copy the directory folder to your target environment.

4. From the Isolated environment, unzip if needed and then run the following for each .whl file:

.. code-block:: powershell

    python -m pip install "\path\to\destination\{whl_file.whl}"

.. note:: If you have an issue installing any of the packages you can use the script from
    the MSTICPy repo "tools" folder `install_all_whl_files.py <https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy/blob/main/tools/install_all_whl_files.py>`__
    to help.

5. Test the installation by running msticpy that suits your needs.


Linux Source to Isolated Linux Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the *Windows Source to Isolated Windows Environment* instructions above.


Windows Source to Isolated Linux Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. On your source Windows machine with internet access, download
   `Docker for Windows <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/>`__.
   We are using docker to ensure that the wheels that we are downloading are meant for the Linux architecture.

2. Run the `download_python_package.py
   <https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy/blob/main/tools/download_python_package.py>`__ script.

Example:

.. code-block:: powershell

    python \path\to\python\file --python-version "3.8.5" --module-name "msticpy[sentinel]" --module-version "2.7.0" --directory \path\to\destination

3. Copy the directory folder to the isolated environment.

4. From the isolated environment, unzip if needed and then you will need to run the following for each .whl file:

.. code-block:: powershell

    python -m pip install "\path\to\destination\{whl_file.whl}"

.. note:: If you have an issue installing any of the packages you can use the script
    from MSTICPy repo "tools" folder
    `install_all_whl_files.py <https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy/blob/main/tools/install_all_whl_files.py>`__
    to help.

5. Test the installation by running some MSTICPy operations in a Jupyter notebook.

If you are installing within a Jupyter Notebooks, you will need to upload your zip file/directory
containing all of the whl files.

If you zipped your transfer archive and need to unzip source files, run the following:

.. code-block:: python

    import zipfile
    import os
    import shutil
    file_path =  "./{zip_file_name}"
    file_name = os.path.split(file_path)[-1]
    file_name_without_ext = os.path.splitext(file_name)[0]
    with zipfile.ZipFile(file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), file_name_without_ext))


- To install the whl files, run the following in a cell:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    directory = "/path/to/whl/files/directory" # edit this to match your directory
    files = [
        os.path.join(directory, filename)
        for filename in os.listdir(directory)
        if filename.endswith(".whl")
    ]
    for file in files:
        filename = os.path.split(file)[-1]
        print(f"\nAttempting to install {filename}")
        %pip install --quiet --no-index --no-deps --find-links . {file}
