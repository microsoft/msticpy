    description: |-
      AWS Security Group Inbound rule overly permissive to all traffic on all protocols.
      Identifies AWS EC2 Security Groups that expose uncommon or non-standard protocols—those other than TCP, UDP, ICMP, or ICMPv6—to the
      public internet via 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0.
      This misconfiguration poses a high risk as it may unintentionally allow access to services using obscure or legacy protocols,
      which are often overlooked in traditional security audits and monitoring.
      Attackers can exploit these exposures to establish covert communication channels, bypass typical detection logic, or target vulnerable services
      for remote code execution or lateral movement.
      Security admins should validate if the exposed protocol is required, restrict access to known IP ranges,
      or remove the rule entirely if not justified.

      publicly reachable and protected by overly permissive Security Groups — potentially allowing access to sensitive ports or services
      from anywhere on the internet. Attackers actively scan for such exposed assets to exploit misconfigurations, deploy malware, or
      gain unauthorized access. Security teams should validate whether public exposure is truly necessary, restrict Security Group rules
      to known IP ranges or VPNs, and ensure critical workloads are behind load balancers or private endpoints when possible.

    description: |-
      Identifies AWS EC2 instances in the 'running' state (state.code = 16) that reside in subnets
      configured to automatically assign public IP addresses (mapPublicIpOnLaunch = true). This represents a
      risk of unintended public exposure, especially if the instance's associated Security Group is permissive.
      Automatically assigning public IPs at subnet level often leads to overexposed infrastructure without
      proper egress controls or visibility. Security teams should evaluate whether these instances require
      public access, and consider moving them to private subnets or disabling auto-assignment of public IPs at the
      subnet level to enforce stricter network boundaries and reduce the external attack surface.

      Identifies AWS EC2 instances that have a public IP address associated via a network interface.
      These instances are directly reachable over the internet, which can increase attack surface
      and lead to unauthorized access if not adequately secured. Public IP association is often
      configured implicitly through networking settings such as Elastic IPs or subnet auto-assign
      configurations. Security teams should evaluate whether public IP access is necessary, validate
      that associated Security Groups and NACLs enforce least privilege, and consider relocating
      such instances to private subnets or routing through bastion hosts or NAT gateways.

      on all protocols (protocol = -1). Such configurations are overly permissive and can expose resources within the subnet
      to a wide range of attacks — including unauthorized access, port scans, and exploitation attempts. Since Network ACLs
      operate at the subnet level and are stateless, this rule permits all traffic into the subnet without restrictions, regardless
      of security group configurations. Security teams should review the necessity of such rules, restrict source CIDRs to known IP ranges,
      and explicitly define allowed protocols and ports to enforce the principle of least privilege at the network perimeter.

  config_resource_publicly_accessible_aws_ec2_autoscaling_launch_configuration:
    description: |-
      Identifies AWS Auto Scaling launch configurations that are set to automatically associate public IP addresses
      with EC2 instances. This setting, when enabled, causes every instance launched via the Auto Scaling Group
      to receive a public IP, potentially making them internet-accessible. If combined with overly permissive
      security groups or public subnets, this can significantly increase the attack surface. Security teams
      should validate whether public IP assignment is necessary, especially for internal services, and
      consider using NAT gateways or private subnets instead. Disabling `associatePublicIpAddress` in
      launch configurations is recommended unless there's a clear use case for public-facing infrastructure.

      or a port range that includes 3389 from any IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0) or IPv6 (::/0) address. Exposure of RDP to the internet
      is a well-known vector for brute-force attacks, ransomware deployment, and lateral movement within cloud environments.
      Attackers continuously scan for exposed RDP endpoints to gain initial access. This rule highlights security groups
      that directly or indirectly open up RDP to the public. Security teams should immediately review such configurations,
      restrict access to known IP ranges or VPN endpoints, and consider disabling RDP where not needed.

  config_resource_telnet_allow_all_inbound_aws_ec2_security_group:

      that includes port 23 from any public IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0) or IPv6 (::/0) address. Telnet is an outdated and
      insecure protocol that transmits data, including credentials, in plaintext. Its exposure to the internet
      introduces critical risk, enabling attackers to intercept or brute-force credentials, execute commands,
      and move laterally within cloud environments. Public-facing Telnet access is a common finding in
      misconfigured legacy environments or lifted-and-shifted workloads. Security teams should immediately
      remove Telnet access from internet-facing rules, replace it with secure alternatives like SSH, and
      review port ranges that may implicitly allow Telnet traffic.

      Identifies non-shared AWS Security Groups that allow inbound access to port 5500 or a port range
      that includes port 5500 from any public IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0) or IPv6 (::/0) address. Port 5500 is commonly
      associated with VNC viewers in reverse connection mode and other remote desktop or support tools.
      When exposed to the internet, this port can be leveraged by attackers to initiate unauthorized remote
      access sessions or exploit vulnerabilities in listening services. This is particularly risky in
      environments using VNC-based tools without strong authentication or encryption. Security teams should
      audit such configurations, restrict access to trusted IPs, and consider disabling remote support
      functionality on cloud-exposed assets where not required.

      Identifies non-shared AWS Security Groups that allow inbound access to port 5900 or a port range
      that includes port 5900 from any public IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0) or IPv6 (::/0) address. Port 5900 is commonly
      used by Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote desktop access. Exposing this port to the internet
      without proper controls can lead to unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and potential remote
      code execution—especially in environments where VNC lacks encryption or strong authentication.
      Attackers often scan for open VNC ports as part of automated campaigns. Security teams should
      ensure remote desktop ports like 5900 are not internet-accessible unless absolutely required,
      and instead use VPN access, bastion hosts, or Zero Trust access mechanisms.

      that includes port 22 from any public IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0) or IPv6 (::/0) address. Open SSH access to the internet
      is a common entry point for attackers performing brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting
      weak keys and misconfigured instances. While SSH is essential for remote administration, unrestricted access
      poses a high risk in production environments. Security teams should ensure SSH is restricted to trusted IP
      addresses, jump hosts, or accessed via secure VPN tunnels. Regular audits and automated detection of exposed
      SSH ports help reduce cloud attack surface and prevent unauthorized access.

      These rules represent a high-risk misconfiguration as they expose instances within the subnet to
      direct attack from the internet, bypassing finer-grained Security Group protections. Since Network ACLs
      are stateless, allowing such traffic inbound means return traffic must also be explicitly allowed —
      creating complexity and risk. Security teams should audit and tighten NACLs to enforce least privilege,
      removing broad allow rules and using scoped, protocol-specific access where absolutely necessary.

      IPv6 (::/0) address using standard protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, or ICMPv6. While these protocols are
      commonly used for legitimate traffic, exposing them broadly to the internet can lead to unauthorized access,
      DDoS exploitation, or reconnaissance activity if specific ports and sources are not restricted. This rule
      highlights security groups with overly permissive rules that can increase the attack surface of cloud assets.
      Security teams should review these rules and apply least privilege by tightening IP ranges, specifying required
      ports, or restricting access to known sources such as bastion hosts, VPNs, or corporate CIDRs.

      Identifies default AWS Security Groups that have one or more inbound or outbound rules configured.
      By default, AWS creates a "default" Security Group for each VPC, and it allows unrestricted communication
      between resources associated with it. If additional rules are added to this default group — especially those
      permitting access from the internet or open egress — it increases the attack surface and can lead to
      unintended exposure. Since the default group is often overlooked in security audits, misconfigurations
      can persist undetected. Security teams should avoid using the default Security Group for production workloads,
      remove any permissive rules, and enforce segmentation by creating custom, least-privilege security groups.

      from resources within the subnet, which can be exploited by malware, reverse shells, or unauthorized data exfiltration.
      Because Network ACLs are stateless, allowing broad egress also implicitly opens the network path for callbacks and
      outbound command-and-control (C2) traffic. Security teams should evaluate whether such unrestricted egress is necessary,
      and where possible, limit outbound traffic by specific destination IPs, ports, and protocols to enforce outbound controls
      and reduce lateral movement and exfiltration risks.

      ports to the internet is a serious security concern, as it opens the door to brute-force attacks, SQL injection attempts,
      and exploitation of known or unknown database service vulnerabilities. Attackers commonly scan for open database ports
      across cloud environments to gain initial foothold or exfiltrate sensitive data. Security teams should immediately restrict
      access to trusted IP ranges, isolate database instances within private subnets, and disable public exposure where not required.
      For cloud-native best practices, access to SQL servers should be routed through bastion hosts, VPNs, or managed proxy layers.

      Identifies non-shared AWS Security Groups that allow inbound access to port 1434, used by the Microsoft SQL Server
      Browser Service, or to a port range that includes 1434, from any public IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0) or IPv6 (::/0) address.
      Port 1434 is used to help clients identify the correct SQL Server instance and port, especially in environments using dynamic ports.
      Exposure of this service to the internet poses a significant risk, as it can aid attackers in identifying and fingerprinting
      SQL Server instances, making them easier targets for further exploitation. This misconfiguration is often seen in poorly secured
      legacy or lift-and-shift workloads. Security teams should restrict access to this port to trusted IPs only, isolate database
      workloads in private subnets, and ensure SQL Browser is disabled if not needed.
