      List of Azure Key Vault which has Firewall disabled.

  config_resource_rbac_disabled_azurekeyvault:
    description: |-
      List of Azure Key Vault instances where Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is not enabled.
      If this query returns results, investigate Azure Key Vault instances where Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      is disabled or not enforced. This condition can expose sensitive information, such as encryption keys,
      secrets, or credentials, to unauthorized access due to inadequate access restrictions.
      Security analysts should verify these instances for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts

  config_resource_no_private_endpoint_azurekeyvault:
    description: |-
      List of Azure Key vaults that are not configured with a private endpoint connection
      If this query returns results, investigate Azure Key Vault resources without configured private endpoint connections.
      Missing private endpoints can expose key vaults to public networks,
      increasing risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, or compromise of sensitive data.
      Identify any unauthorized or unexpected access attempts to these key vaults, and ensure private endpoints are correctly
      configured to restrict access strictly to trusted networks.

  config_resource_noexpiry_nonrbac_azurekeyvault:
    description: |-
      List of Azure Key Vault keys that do not have an expiration date for the Non-RBAC Key vaults
      If this query returns results, investigate Azure Key Vault keys in Non-RBAC vaults that have no expiration date configured.
      Keys without expiration dates pose security risks by potentially enabling long-term unauthorized access if compromised.
      Security teams should verify these keys for legitimacy, assess if they are still necessary,
      and implement expiration dates to enforce regular key rotation.

  config_resource_noexpiry_nonrbac_secret_azurekeyvault:
    description: |-
      List of Azure Key Vault secrets that do not have an expiry date for the Non-RBAC Key vaults
      If this query returns results, investigate Azure Key Vault secrets without expiry dates in non-RBAC vaults.
      Secrets without expiry can pose prolonged security risks if compromised, as attackers may exploit them indefinitely.
      Identify and review these secrets for unusual access patterns or unauthorized usage.
      Ensure secret rotation policies or expiry dates are enforced to mitigate potential risks
      associated with compromised credentials.

  config_resource_noexpiry_rbac_azurekeyvault:
    description: |-
      Lists of Azure Key Vault Keys that have no expiration date (RBAC Key vault)
      If this query returns results, investigate Azure Key Vault keys without expiration dates specifically
      in RBAC-enabled vaults. Keys without expiry in RBAC-enabled vaults pose distinct security risks compared
      to non-RBAC vaults, as RBAC-controlled vaults rely on role assignments and permissions which
      could potentially grant prolonged unauthorized access if compromised keys are not rotated or expired.
      Analyze any suspicious or unauthorized access patterns associated with these keys and ensure proper
      lifecycle management, particularly distinguishing them from non-RBAC vaults
      where permission structures differ.

  config_resource_noexpiry_rbac_secret_azurekeyvault:
    description: |-
      Lists of Azure Key Vault secrets that have no expiration date (RBAC Key vault)
      If this query returns results, investigate Azure Key Vault secrets without expiration dates specifically
      in RBAC-enabled vaults. Secrets lacking expiration pose heightened risks as they remain potentially
      exploitable indefinitely if compromised. RBAC-enabled vaults offer more granular access control,
      but prolonged validity without expiration can weaken security controls.
      Analysts should proactively assess these secrets, monitor for unauthorized access attempts, and
      implement expiration policies.
