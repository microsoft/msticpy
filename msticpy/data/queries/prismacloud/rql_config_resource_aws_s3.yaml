      If this query returns results, investigate AWS S3 bucket policies granting write actions (e.g. s3:Put*, s3:Delete*, s3:*) to
      any principal other than the owning account.
      Granting write access enables unauthorized users to upload, modify, or delete objects and even host malicious content.
      This risk can lead to data tampering, supply-chain attacks, compliance violations, and operational disruption.
      Security teams should restrict write permissions to specific IAM roles or ARNs and enable
      Public Access Block controls for all S3 buckets.

  config_resource_allow_all_principals_for_all_actions_aws_s3bucket:

      List of AWS S3 buckets whose bucket policies allow any principal to perform any S3 action without conditions.
      If this query returns results, investigate each buckets policy for unrestricted “Allow” statements granting s3:*
      or other S3 actions to “*” or external ARNs.
      Unconditional policy grants enable anonymous or cross-account users to read, write, delete objects,
      modify bucket ACLs or policies, and change encryption settings.
      This risk can lead to data exfiltration, tampering of critical assets,
      hosting of malicious content, and disruption of operations.
      Security teams should restrict bucket policy principals to specific IAM roles or ARNs, scope allowed actions narrowly,
      and enforce Public Access Block (`restrictPublicBuckets=true`) at both account and bucket levels.

      List of AWS S3 buckets with public ACL or policy-based access not blocked by Public Access Block settings.
      If this query returns results, investigate buckets where an `AllUsers` ACL grant or `policyStatus.isPublic` is effectively honored.
      Public access via ACLs or bucket policies can lead to unauthorized enumeration, data exposure, or tampering of S3 objects.
      This risk can result in compliance violations, data breaches, and reputational damage.
      Security teams should enable Public Access Block
      (BlockPublicAcls, BlockPublicPolicy, RestrictPublicBuckets), disable ACLs, and enforce BucketOwnerEnforced on all S3 buckets.

  config_resource_publicly_access_to_cloudtrail_s3bucket:
    description: |-
      List of AWS S3 buckets used by CloudTrail that are publicly accessible via ACL or bucket policy.
      If this query returns results, investigate each CloudTrail log bucket where an `AllUsers` ACL grant or
      `policyStatus.isPublic` is effectively honored despite no Public Access Block settings.
      Public exposure of CloudTrail buckets risks unauthorized reading or tampering of your audit logs,
      impairing security monitoring and forensic investigations.
      This can lead to undetected breaches, loss of critical audit data, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
      Security teams should immediately enable Public Access Block (BlockPublicAcls, BlockPublicPolicy, RestrictPublicBuckets),
      disable ACLs, enforce BucketOwnerEnforced, and lock down CloudTrail buckets to approved principals only.

  config_resource_enforced_access_via_vpc_endpoint_aws_s3_bucket:
    description: |-
      List of AWS S3 buckets whose bucket policies include VPC endpoint based conditions (`aws:SourceVpce`).
      If this query returns results, investigate policy statements using:
        - `Condition.StringEquals` with `Effect:Allow` to permit traffic only from specified VPC endpoints.
        - `Condition.StringNotEquals` with `Effect:Deny` to block all other sources.
      Misconfigured or overly broad endpoint conditions can inadvertently grant access to unauthorized VPCs, peered accounts,
      or shared endpoints.
      Attackers who exploit a compromised or misnamed VPC endpoint could exfiltrate data,
      modify objects, or bypass network controls.
      Security teams should verify that each policy references only exact, approved endpoint IDs, avoid wildcards,
      and periodically test enforcement to prevent unauthorized access.

    description: |-
      List of AWS S3 buckets encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key whose default key
      policy grants access to any principal without conditions.
      If this query returns results, investigate each bucket `kmsMasterKeyID` and
      inspect the corresponding CMK default policy for unconditioned `Principal="*"` or wildcard ARNs.
      An unscoped key policy allows unauthorized AWS principals to decrypt, encrypt, or re-encrypt bucket objects,
      leading to data exfiltration, tampering, or bypass of encryption controls.
      Security teams should tighten key policies by restricting principals to specific IAM roles or ARNs,
      adding conditions (e.g., `aws:SourceVpce`, `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`), and enabling key rotation.
