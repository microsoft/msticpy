description: |
  'Anomaly Rules generate events in the Anomalies table. This scheduled rule tries to detect Anomalies that are not usual, they could be a type of Anomaly that has recently been activated, or an infrequent type. The detected Anomaly should be reviewed, if it is relevant enough, eventually a separate scheduled Analytics Rule could be created specifically for that Anomaly Type, so an alert and/or incident is generated everytime that type of Anomaly happens.'
